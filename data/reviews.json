However, as I was in the vicinity, I decided to check out the restaurant anyway. I'm delighted to share that my experience completely dispelled any doubts, and I feel compelled to offer my own take here so that others have another opinion to consider. The ambiance alone deserves high praise, as it offers breathtaking views of the sea, yachts, and the stunning sunset. The combination of these elements creates an unforgettable setting that sets the stage for a memorable dining experience.\n\nNow, let's talk about the highlight of the evening\u2014the food. We started our culinary journey with a classic favorite, the pepperoni pizza. It arrived piping hot, with a perfectly thin and crispy crust. The rich tomato sauce, generous cheese, and flavorful pepperoni made it an absolute delight.\n\nNext up was the clam linguine pasta, a true masterpiece. The pasta was cooked to perfection, al dente, and the delicate clams added a delightful briny note to every bite. The sauce was light and balanced, allowing the freshness of the ingredients to shine through. It was a dish that left us wanting more.\n\nThe catch of the day was another winner. Prepared with finesse, the fish was beautifully presented and expertly seasoned. The tender flesh practically melted in our mouths, and each bite revealed a symphony of flavors. The dish showcased the chef's skill in capturing the essence of the sea.\n\nTo accompany our main courses, we indulged in a side of truffle fries. These golden delights were cooked to perfection, with a crispy exterior and a fluffy interior. The earthy aroma of truffle elevated these fries to a whole new level of decadence. It was hard to resist devouring them all.\n\nOverall, our experience at this restaurant was nothing short of exceptional. The negative review we encountered beforehand seemed unfounded once we stepped into the inviting atmosphere and tasted the superb dishes.

The dish consisted of a generous amount of diced sashimi served on a bed of rice. The sashimi was incredibly fresh and juicy, making each bite a delight.\n\nThe Spanish Sliced Pork Belly Donburi was another standout dish. It featured a perfect onsen egg atop a generous portion of thinly sliced pork belly. The balance between the fatty and lean meat was just right, resulting in a flavorful and satisfying combination.\n\nFor those craving a comforting bowl of ramen, the Tonkotsu Ramen at Komezu is a must-try. The rich pork broth, accompanied by springy noodles and two sizable slices of char siu, provided both warmth and satiation. The slight torching of the char siu added an extra level of flavor that truly enhanced the dish.\n\nIf you're a fan of the classic Oyakodon Donburi, Komezu does not disappoint. The combination of egg and rice in this dish creates a rich and creamy texture that is truly a match made in heaven.\n\nIn addition to the delightful sets, Komezu's sushi and maki offerings were also awesome. The prices for these items, as well as the sashimi, were surprisingly affordable, making it an excellent choice for a simple yet hearty meal.", "First visit to new ORTO. they have Japanese restaurant inside of building and I'm pleasantly surprised by the the quality of the ramen and soup.

The mala beef noodle was not too bad though I wished it could be more spicy. What I was a little disappointed with was the consistency and speed of dishes served.

Clearly, unimpressed, we seek a second opinion and realised it\u2019s meant to be drank after completing the dessert to clear the palate. I think it\u2019s quite unnecessary though but I think I get their intention but had poor explanation. Both desserts get double thumbs up.\n\nWhat should have been a great end to the night was again marred by the server who once again hurriedly came to clear the table and removed my negroni which I have not completed drinking. I was too tired to protest.\n\nOverall quite impressed on our first visit here. Certainly not the cheapest but the food is certainly enjoyable.

Not a typical fine dinning setting but more of a simple sit down dinning for a close group of friends to meet up and chat over a hearty meal.\n\nThe restaurant serves some of the more classical French dishes such as foil gras and escargot, with choices of either cold or warm appetisers dishes. It seems the white asparagus is in season now and we ordered 1/2 dozen of escargots and the foie gras (served with toasted country bread) to go with it for our starters.\n\nThe escargot was baked with parsley and garlic butter. Classical proven dish that couldn\u2019t really go wrong, but nothing outstanding either. Felt that the escargots was a tad over baked for me as the meat was slightly tough. Overall the taste was rich and flavourful, and the leftover butter oil makes great dip for the bread. 3/5\n\nThe white asparagus was served with Parma ham, Benedict eggs and hollandaise sauce. The asparagus was crunchy and juicy, and would have paired perfectly with the savoury ham, if not for the lingering bitter vegetal aftertaste coming from the asparagus. Not sure what the Benedict egg and hollandaise sauce bring to the dish, didn\u2019t think the sauce went well with the dish. 3/5\n\nThe foie gras serving was generous! Some of the inferior foie gras I tasted had a powdery and crumbly texture with a strong metallic iron aftertaste lingering. But the foie gras served here was of a much higher quality. Smooth and buttery with a right proportion of fat; lighter in taste but yet flavourful (from the meat) and rich without being too overpowering. It left you wanting to try more as it didn\u2019t have the saturating greasy feeling. The yellow portion of the foie gras in the picture was actually solidified fat and simply pure decadent! I would strongly encourage everyone to at least try a small bit of it to savour the slow melting of pure animal fat essence in your mouth! The reddish condiment at the side was some sort of dried fruit puree and the slight sweet-sourness went very well with the savoury foie gras. The only disappointment I had with the dish was the hard country bread, but otherwise excellent dish. 4.5/5\n\nWe ordered 3 mains for sharing:  lamb tongue (not in regular menu), beef tartare and ribeye steak\n\nPersonally I prefer my lamb to be grilled for that rich \u201cmuttony\u201d favour. This lamb tongue was stewed and served on top of potato mash. I chose this main as lamb tongue was an interesting cut I had not tried before despite the cooking style. The meat was tender with a bit of chewiness to it. Taste was delicately light and I hardly get any \u2018muttony\u2019 favour in it. This was a very nice dish albeit it didn\u2019t suit my personal taste preference. 3.5/5, only because of personal taste preference, otherwise the dish deserved a 4.\n\nThe beef tartare was disappointing. I loved the Angus beef for its \u2018sashimi freshness quality\u2019 with a slight chewy texture. But the condiment was a tad overpowering from the pungent shedded onion and the overly tangy dressing. I felt that the taste was off balanced in the mouth, skewing more towards the condiment. Texture was good, chewiness of the meat went well with the onion crunchiness. The bread was disappointing hard. 3/5\n\nSaving the best for the last, the ribeye was the highlight of the meal for us. Perfectly grilled to medium rare with a pinkish tender center (an expected standard for any high end restaurant) and a slight crusty charred exterior. Decent fat content and the juice of the meat was well sealed during the cooking. Every mouthful was a fine balance of favour and texture. Tenderness of the meat interspersed with crispy charred parts, full bodied and juicy meat favour elevated by the light seasoning. It also went very well with the B\u00e9arnaise sauce as it presented a different taste profile. Just to show you don\u2019t need super expensive beef cut or A5 wagyu to enjoy a premium quality steak. 5/5", "Lovely French-looking restaurant that\u2019s well-lit too. Perfect amount of light IMO.

My wife thought it was perfectly seasoned and not too salty, though I thought it was a tad on the salty side, which was good for the first few bites, but started to be a bit too much towards the end. The bernaise sauce was one of the only negative points for us. It was too clumpy and didn't add anything to the taste of the beef. I wouldn't get it again.

Served on a bed of mint raita and Bengali chutney. The flavours were melt in the mouth wonderful.\n\nDessert was a chocolate cheesecake, jivara chocolate sorbet and a honey meringue. The honey meringue was in a honeycomb shape that looked really nice but tasted just a bit too light for me. Cheesecake was the usual fare and could be a bit heavy to end such a big meal.

The pork chop was kinda plain and the batter used was a little tough. The scallion noodles looked plain but were quite fragrant. The sweet-sour cucumber pickles also lent the dish a visual lift. The braised pork rice came with three big slabs of pork belly, a gooey centered braised egg and salted mustard leaves. It was well balanced, without being too sweet or salty.\n\nThe vinegared dumplings were one of the most unique versions I had tasted. There was a strong scent of plums and the broth was light and refreshing.\n\nThe milk tea sucks though, it was so diluted and tasted more like diluted Nescaf\u00e9 with condensed milk. The almond paste dessert was so good, it was not overly sweet I took a mouth and finished the entire bowl without taking a photo.\n\nI would be really glad if they had some legit vegetable options.
