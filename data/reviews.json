However, as I was in the vicinity, I decided to check out the restaurant anyway. I'm delighted to share that my experience completely dispelled any doubts, and I feel compelled to offer my own take here so that others have another opinion to consider. The ambiance alone deserves high praise, as it offers breathtaking views of the sea, yachts, and the stunning sunset. The combination of these elements creates an unforgettable setting that sets the stage for a memorable dining experience.Now, let's talk about the highlight of the eveningthe food. We started our culinary journey with a classic favorite, the pepperoni pizza. It arrived piping hot, with a perfectly thin and crispy crust. The rich tomato sauce, generous cheese, and flavorful pepperoni made it an absolute delight.Next up was the clam linguine pasta, a true masterpiece. The pasta was cooked to perfection, al dente, and the delicate clams added a delightful briny note to every bite. The sauce was light and balanced, allowing the freshness of the ingredients to shine through. It was a dish that left us wanting more.The catch of the day was another winner. Prepared with finesse, the fish was beautifully presented and expertly seasoned. The tender flesh practically melted in our mouths, and each bite revealed a symphony of flavors. The dish showcased the chef's skill in capturing the essence of the sea.To accompany our main courses, we indulged in a side of truffle fries. These golden delights were cooked to perfection, with a crispy exterior and a fluffy interior. The earthy aroma of truffle elevated these fries to a whole new level of decadence. It was hard to resist devouring them all.Overall, our experience at this restaurant was nothing short of exceptional.

What I would recommend to order for the hot pot is the Nourishing soup, dumplings, mushroom basket and quail eggs.They do provide other rooms where its like a KTV style of experience where you can bring ur uncle bosses to drink tiger and Heineken with a disco light ball. Lots of China alcohol here as well.Quite family friendly as well as staffs are just a male and female and 2 kids who seem to be helping their parents by bringing cutleries over  cute kids", "I feel a strong need to bring up the low ratings in Google Review as this place really isn't as bad as what many people said.Firstly, the food is actually decent. Vegetables are fresh, prawns and meat are nice. The skewers chicken wings is quite good too. The Tom yam soup doesn't taste typical though. Price may be abit higher than average steamboat but it is still reasonable.As long as we don't compare with HDL or beauty in a pot, then it's really not too bad.The main attraction here is still the deco which is really instagramable. However the deco feels more suitable for lovers/couples, although it's alright for families as well.Service was good from the start till the end too so no complaints.So finally the reason for the 4 stars and not 5 is because of the location and more importantly to us, the heat! It may not be that hot, but with the steamboat, then it can get really uncomfortable. But we heard they are speaking with the management on providing a fan of some sorts in the near future. So let's see if they can earn the last star from me soon!Overall, 8/10 and I will be back again with the right person!am not sure why but perhaps they have improved recently."], "ChIJ4x2BTLwb2jERIn49QgWOJyo": ["Very new restaurant with an eye-opening performance experience with beautiful LIVE mermaids.

I didnt want the ikura so i was given more sashimi  The price was affordable and was pleasantly surprised that it came with a chawanmushi and miso soup too!", "We have just finished our dinner at Komezu, a causal Japanese restaurant located at Orto West Coast, and I must say it was a delightful experience. We ordered four sets and each one exceeded our expectations.Despite being a self-service establishment, the staff at Komezu were incredibly friendly and helpful.One of the highlights of our meal was the Classic Bara Chirashi. The dish consisted of a generous amount of diced sashimi served on a bed of rice. The sashimi was incredibly fresh and juicy, making each bite a delight.The Spanish Sliced Pork Belly Donburi was another standout dish. It featured a perfect onsen egg atop a generous portion of thinly sliced pork belly. The balance between the fatty and lean meat was just right, resulting in a flavorful and satisfying combination.For those craving a comforting bowl of ramen, the Tonkotsu Ramen at Komezu is a must-try. The rich pork broth, accompanied by springy noodles and two sizable slices of char siu, provided both warmth and satiation. The slight torching of the char siu added an extra level of flavor that truly enhanced the dish.If you're a fan of the classic Oyakodon Donburi, Komezu does not disappoint. The combination of egg and rice in this dish creates a rich and creamy texture that is truly a match made in heaven.In addition to the delightful sets, Komezu's sushi and maki offerings were also awesome. The prices for these items, as well as the sashimi, were surprisingly affordable, making it an excellent choice for a simple yet hearty meal.", "Food was really good and service was excellent.

As a result, this stretch of restaurants is frequented by the NUS students especially during the supper runs.It's the new kid of the block. The chilli ban mian was pretty ordinary. The chilli was good, the noodles were cooked to perfection; I particularly liked the garlic chips that were added to it. The bitterness of the garlic plus the chilli ban mian marinated almost flawlessly. However, garlic chips aside, it's just an ordinary bowl of pan mee. Hearty bowl, not exactly, I reckon most students could easily eat 2 bowls - out of pocket by $11.60 for 2 bowls of Dry Ban Mian. Expensive? Most definitely, but, what's not pricey these days?Damage: Expensive for street food with such a small proportion.Come back again?

The mala beef noodle can be shared between 2 persons. The spicy chicken can be shared between 2-3 persons. Secondly on the taste, thee spring onion pancakes were awesome. The Lu Rou Fan was average. The La Zhi Ji lacks the punch in terms of spiciness and numbness and you can see that they werent cooked/fried thoroughly as some parts lack the seasonings. The mala beef noodle was not too bad though I wished it could be more spicy. What I was a little disappointed with was the consistency and speed of dishes served. It seems like the kitchen cooks similar dishes in batches instead of cooking based on order received. You will see that same dishes will be delivered to multiple tables at the same time. As for our order, the first one Lu Rou Fan came almost immediately after we ordered, the last one which was the mala noodle came 45 minutes after.

Capella has made significant improvements since my last visit, and it has once again lived up to its exceptional standards. The following aspects stood out during my stay:1. Service: The level of service at Capella has vastly improved. It is evident that all the staff members have undergone thorough training, as they exhibited a high level of professionalism and attentiveness. They were always ready to assist with any request, and their genuine warmth and hospitality made my stay truly memorable.2. Room Hygiene and Maintenance: The cleanliness and maintenance of the rooms were noticeably enhanced. The rooms were immaculate, and the attention to detail in maintaining the electronics and other amenities was commendable. It truly added to the overall comfort and enjoyment of my stay.3. Personal Touches: I would like to express my gratitude for the wonderful surprises prepared for my wife and sister during our visit. The thoughtful gestures made their experience extra special and showed the hotel's commitment to creating lasting memories for their guests.4. Exceptional Assistance: I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to Joan for her outstanding assistance in handling my booking and ensuring that all my needs were met. Her attention to detail and dedication to providing exceptional service made a significant difference in my overall experience.5. Efficient Maintenance Support: I would also like to thank Isaac, the technician, for promptly addressing an issue with the air conditioning in my room during the late hours of the night. His professionalism and swift resolution of the problem were truly commendable.The only area that could benefit from some improvement is the Living Room, previously known as the Library. While it still retains its charm, a few updates to the ambience and amenities could elevate the overall experience even further.Overall, I am extremely impressed with the remarkable improvements made at Capella Singapore. It has regained its previous glory and surpassed my expectations. The impeccable service, enhanced room maintenance, and thoughtful gestures made my stay truly unforgettable. I highly recommend Capella Singapore to anyone seeking a luxurious and memorable retreat.This review is based on my recent experience, and it is evident that Capella has made substantial improvements since my last visit.", "Let's get the elephant out of the room first, this is by no means a \"cheap\" hotel. It is however a reasonably priced location and for what it's worth, provides an experience beyond what you are paying for.The experience starts prior to your stay at this destination, expect a call from their certified culturists as they prepare you for your stay with them. Every detail is gone through and preparations made with much effort to ensure a seamless experience.When you are at capella, expect to be greeted and serviced from every moment you interact with the staff, as they exude an air of professionalism while attending to your every needs. It's nothing short of amazing how consistent they are.The rooms, furniture, amenities are all top of the line, I will let the pictures speak for themselves. Rooms as clean and spacious and amenities, generous.What I think really makes this resort stand out from the rest is the experience you will have here. Sure the location helps, but it's the people you meet that cements the experience, from the concierge, lobby staff, concierge, and even waitresses. Capella had done an excellent job ironing out the consistency and that's something that's truly admirable.It's my second stay here, and I can safely say it will certainly not be the last. Every guest coming here should expect alot from the place, and I dare say with certainty there will be no disappointment.", "I can count on one hand the number of reviews I have left in my lifetime, but I couldnt leave this amazing hotel without giving it 5*.

The highlight was definitely the view - it was stunning and made for the perfect backdrop to a relaxing day.The service could have been better, but overall it was acceptable.

Despite this, we still managed to find a spot in the pool and enjoy the rest of our day.The club can get crowded, but it didn't detract too much from the overall experience. We were still able to find a peaceful and relaxing spot to soak up the sun and take in the view.Overall, I would say we were happy with our experience at Tanjong Beach Club.

We actually had it in their indoor tables because its drizzling and got some lightnings. Staff are really prompt to inform us as we booked their sunbed.

Very smooth transition as the staff sorted our bill first then gave us a new tab number for our sunbed.Its always busy at Tanjong Beach Club so better to plan ahead and book your table/sunbed.

In general, their food is very good. Perhaps the one dish that we both didnt care for on our last visit was the classic sptzle with onions and cheese. The problem is that there is garlic in the dish that just ruins the flavor. Before you ask, I love garlic, both cooked and raw, so when I tell you that garlic ruins the flavor of this dish, I mean it. Get the other one or maybe a small side of you want some sptzle. The potato salad on the other hand was delicious. For a dish you dont expect much from, it was quite tasty. All the meat mains are good, and the kaiserschmarrn desert is a must. Also, if you havent done so already, sign up for their membership problem and remember to give them your mobile number when paying the bill. Its easy to rack up cash savings, which helps to offset the cost. Its really the price that keeps me from giving them five stars. All the same, recommended.

This was definitely delicious but I felt like it turned cold and the cheese turned hard too quickly. Perhaps serving in a cast iron pan would help retain the heat. The vongole was definitely too buttery, it felt like a novice chef added too much butter! There was hardly any other flavor. The 36h slow cooked beef chef on the other hand was to die for. Seriously unbelievably tender and the bed of Japanese purple sweet potato was also well done and paired nicely to the strong beefy taste.Overall a great meal.

The Beancurd skin was bland, but softly and well cooked.

Both dishes were average.Walk-In during Weekends are not advisable, so its best to make reservations. You also get patrons standing around you waiting for seats, while you are eating.. very much like a food court or Hawker centre as the restaurant dont have a proper waiting or holding area.I feel the restaurant management needs to manage their reception better, but dont think they are bothered about it as business is brisk, especially when there are lots of foreign patrons.And i do think they prefer foreign than local patrons, especially after being given the bill while still in the middle of my meal (when i did not call for it) and a group of foreign patrons crowding around the table watching us eat. And maybe because of this, the Cashier issued us the Bill after i saw her walked past our table.One of their senior waitress who have been attending to us, noticed our ordeal and apologized to us a few times. and Thanks to her, we had the mood to continue our meal.Wont return again, since they dont need our business anyway.", "Food was generally not bad! I would highly recommend the hot plate beancurd which tasted really good for a simple dish! Their champagne pork rib tasted not bad but more on a fatty side, the sauce was quite thick and will go jelat if eat too many. Sweet and sour pork quite crispy but taste average. Fried rice was not bad! Dragon vege was just normal. Might come here to try other dishes in future.", "Located near Tiong Bahru MRT and Tiong Bahru market.

I especially liked the Penang style dishes, but perhaps the coconut can be too lemak after eating a few bites.The service staff is kind and friendly.

We've felt really comfortable on both our visits. For starters we had the escargot and bone marrow. It was really good. We ordered 2 rib-eye with bearnaise sauce and a ravioli for mains.The only thing we were not really comfortable with was how close the table next to us was. Overall we had a lovely time.", "A Belgian in a French Brasserie what could possibly go wrong.Nothing actually. Superb business lunch. Relaxing atmosphere, warm traditional interior, capable and attentive staff, and the food - oh man - the food!!Tried the morel mushroom soup and the evergreen Angus Beef tartare. Sublime! Just the way Id expect it in the best restaurant in Paris, or Brussels. And even the fries are Belgian Approved.Thanks guys", "Stepping inside Brasserie Gavroche, it had a nice old rustic charm to it, with the vintage looking wooden furnitures and 50s style hanging lights. Not a typical fine dinning setting but more of a simple sit down dinning for a close group of friends to meet up and chat over a hearty meal.The restaurant serves some of the more classical French dishes such as foil gras and escargot, with choices of either cold or warm appetisers dishes. It seems the white asparagus is in season now and we ordered 1/2 dozen of escargots and the foie gras (served with toasted country bread) to go with it for our starters.The escargot was baked with parsley and garlic butter. Classical proven dish that couldnt really go wrong, but nothing outstanding either. Felt that the escargots was a tad over baked for me as the meat was slightly tough. Overall the taste was rich and flavourful, and the leftover butter oil makes great dip for the bread. 3/5The white asparagus was served with Parma ham, Benedict eggs and hollandaise sauce. The asparagus was crunchy and juicy, and would have paired perfectly with the savoury ham, if not for the lingering bitter vegetal aftertaste coming from the asparagus. Not sure what the Benedict egg and hollandaise sauce bring to the dish, didnt think the sauce went well with the dish. 3/5The foie gras serving was generous! Some of the inferior foie gras I tasted had a powdery and crumbly texture with a strong metallic iron aftertaste lingering. But the foie gras served here was of a much higher quality. Smooth and buttery with a right proportion of fat; lighter in taste but yet flavourful (from the meat) and rich without being too overpowering. It left you wanting to try more as it didnt have the saturating greasy feeling. The yellow portion of the foie gras in the picture was actually solidified fat and simply pure decadent! I would strongly encourage everyone to at least try a small bit of it to savour the slow melting of pure animal fat essence in your mouth! The reddish condiment at the side was some sort of dried fruit puree and the slight sweet-sourness went very well with the savoury foie gras. The only disappointment I had with the dish was the hard country bread, but otherwise excellent dish. 4.5/5We ordered 3 mains for sharing:  lamb tongue (not in regular menu), beef tartare and ribeye steakPersonally I prefer my lamb to be grilled for that rich muttony favour. This lamb tongue was stewed and served on top of potato mash. I chose this main as lamb tongue was an interesting cut I had not tried before despite the cooking style. The meat was tender with a bit of chewiness to it. Taste was delicately light and I hardly get any muttony favour in it. This was a very nice dish albeit it didnt suit my personal taste preference. 3.5/5, only because of personal taste preference, otherwise the dish deserved a 4.The beef tartare was disappointing. I loved the Angus beef for its sashimi freshness quality with a slight chewy texture. But the condiment was a tad overpowering from the pungent shedded onion and the overly tangy dressing. I felt that the taste was off balanced in the mouth, skewing more towards the condiment. Texture was good, chewiness of the meat went well with the onion crunchiness. The bread was disappointing hard. 3/5Saving the best for the last, the ribeye was the highlight of the meal for us. Perfectly grilled to medium rare with a pinkish tender center (an expected standard for any high end restaurant) and a slight crusty charred exterior. Decent fat content and the juice of the meat was well sealed during the cooking. Every mouthful was a fine balance of favour and texture. Tenderness of the meat interspersed with crispy charred parts, full bodied and juicy meat favour elevated by the light seasoning. It also went very well with the Barnaise sauce as it presented a different taste profile. Just to show you dont need super expensive beef cut or A5 wagyu to enjoy a premium quality steak. 5/5", "Lovely French-looking restaurant thats well-lit too. Perfect amount of light IMO. Ordered half a dozen of oysters but I reckoned the wait staff only heard dozen lol.

I especially enjoyed the scallop carpaccio and pumpkin flan. Swapped the tagliatelle for an uni pasta for an additional 18$.

And with the set lunch special it's even quite affordable.", "We had the omakase at $318 for 2 people ( 1 for 1 deal).  4+1 dishes were served.  My favorite dish was red prawn cappaccio and least favorite was cod fish which was very average and dont command this kind of pricing.  Least memorable experience was when the manager asked if we would like to have cod or beef and after we took the decision to have beef, he then said we need to top up (how much was not given).  We were taken aback, isnt this an omakase meal?

Well, Meat had good charring on the outside and tender inside. Sauce to Meat ratio was good for me, but i prefer my pork ribs to be a little softer inside.Their Classic Tiramisu with Authentic Pistachio Paste was light, creamy and airy.Overall, a must go place if i have craving for Sourdough Pizza.

Perhaps I was not a fan of the sauce in that dish.  - this may be because I have a cheese allergy and requested for no dairy and so maybe those dishes would have been better with cheese?

My wife thought it was perfectly seasoned and not too salty, though I thought it was a tad on the salty side, which was good for the first few bites, but started to be a bit too much towards the end. The bernaise sauce was one of the only negative points for us. It was too clumpy and didn't add anything to the taste of the beef. I wouldn't get it again. The lobster tail was very fresh, and the broccolini was very substantial.

The salmon tasted a tad too fishy (just to avoid misunderstanding: I think it was fresh, it just had an unusually strong taste of salmon, which I didnt taste at other places; and I order eggs Ben a lot as it is one of my favorites).So overall, it was ok but not that outstanding. 4 out of 5."], "ChIJp4zYJ6QZ2jEREFWylAnM_W0": ["Without a doubt, 5 Stars ! the food was delicious and the service was very friendly. yes, it was a bit of a wait, but all in all that was pretty OK.

Sadly, the quality of ala carte cooking seems to have diminished in terms of char kuay teow (ckt) and hokkien mee.Frankly, the standard of ala carte dishes shouldn't be sacrificed for the buffet dishes if the chefs are consistent. Found the ckt too wet and oily, very untypical of true Penang style. Hokkien mee soup was quite tasteless and seemed more like diluted stock.. The lor bak tasted better, with just the right flavour and skin crispiness. However, it came without the quintessential sauce (lor) nor chilly sauce! Whoever prepared it from the kitchen clearly forgot to remind the waiters.Ambience-wise, it's fairly well decorated though lacking an authentic Penang feel.

The Sambal KangKong has that homely style cooking,  similar to mom's. Another item worth a mention is the curry chicken,  with that hint of sour in it,  bringing out the life.Finally,  never leave this place without trying the Chendol,  always leave room for dessert. It's not too sweet,  though heavy on the coconut.Overall,  service is fast,  speedy in fact.

As off late had observed the skin was thicker perhaps for easier handling of the dumplings! It also may be due to the better skill of the chef here and hence this branch is more recommended!If its your 1st time allow the dumplings to cool down a minute or so to avoid burning your tongue from the hot soup inside !The shrimp omelette also tastes great !Instead of water , better to take a Yasmine tea or other house pour with endless top ups !The nice experience we keep coming back for !", "great service, as usual good quality Chinese food.

Cocktails are strong yet yummyyyy. Food is good too, love their fusion/Asian items such as kueh pie tee and the fried rice, which comes in an ample portion. Fries were a little underwhelming, surprisingly. Prices are a wee bit on the higher side but y'know with inflation I think these price levels are fast becoming the norm......

The chicken skin was not really crispy but it was somewhat addictive.Miso shitake buns were tasty but was kind of expecting more out of it, since it was highly reviewed. The rendition of charred napa cabbage was right up my alley. Yums!Smoked crispy pork and chargrilled wagyu all good. Loved the meats.Main course of Wood smoked beef brisket didn't disappoint. We tried both the point end and naval end. Fork tender and flavourful. The garam masala marinade was lovely. We ate the brisket together with the dirty rice basmati. Added a touch of chilli balado to my plate for a level up.For drinks, I think I like the lychee lager the most.Staff was friendly and tried their best to answer our questions.For dessert, can't go wrong with basque cheesecake. Not sure about the smokey lychee flavour but loved it with the blueberries and honey compote.

Prior to serving, the server mixed up the dish - coating the fluffy eggwhites, crab, and scallops with richness from the egg yolk and sauce. The dish is as creamy as it looks, so do add vinegar to keep it interesting. Foshan Old Coconut Soup with Farm Chicken (9/10)Light, fragrant, and refreshing! Slow cooking the chicken, and various herbs (wolf berry, yam) in the old coconut bring about an aromatic soup with a natural coconut sweetness. Loved the sweet, and savoury umami flavours which were delightful. I wish there was more soup! Compared to the other dishes, the the coconut contains about 3-4bowls of soup. Deep fried egg plant in pork floss (8/10)These crispy eggplants house meltingly soft, juicy flesh within, and is showered with pork floss. The pork floss came in handy as we scooped some of this into our vermicelli to add additional flavours and textures. Crispy Homemade Shrimp & Pork Roll (7/10)Savoury and crunchy, disguised meatball with crisp beancurd skin and packed with water chestnut pieces. Traditional Homemade Yam Puree with Pumpkin and Gingko Nuts (Warm) (7.5/10)The orh nee was fragrant and smooth. Loved the additional depth with scallions. Chopped water chestnuts, steamed pumpkin slices, and gingko nuts added a layer of texture. This version does not contain coconut milk, only sugar syrup. Would have preferred it thicker.

Drinks are slightly pricey but in recent years bubble tea has gotten really expensive, so in comparison xw drinks are alright. Soy milk is sweet, which is to my liking. Water is chargeable at 50c but refillable. Mango pomelo with ice cream is delicious, almost every table orders one to share. Very spacious and clean, service staff are good.

Their mashed potatoes  is also a little fragrant and large portion.We also got their beef burger  which has such a tiny cut of meat its not even funny. They grill their buns too so the whole thing has the charred taste. The gooey cheese  covers only 30% of the meat and overall not worth.Finally we ate their chicken  which was very crunchy and juicy. But it was drowned in this carbonara(?) sauce which was too creamy for us already.

Amazing that they had such great produce from Australia and their own gardens (you can go around the back and walk through the greenery, try to spot some of the food you ate)!Food was great, wine pairings awesome, and really enjoyed our time there. 5/5 will come back again soon!", "I came here for dinner.  Food is good, but very pricy.  Definitely good for private and more intimate meals if you book the garden dome. There are three garden domes.The taste of the 65 Florentine egg and truffle was masked by the spinach, but the taste of the spinach was great.The French onion soup was sweet and thicker which was surprising.The wagyu striplion was done as a roast and delightful to have with some charring on the sides.The duck confit was good and not too salty.The sorbet was refreshing and the jelly lovely to chew on.Creme brle was good as well.Good place for more intimate moments.", "Visited this restaurant on 15 Feb. Extremely good service provided by Aska who is so passionate about his job. Knowing I'm pregnant, he went out of the way to ensure the food options were suitable for me. He also helped hubby and I take very nice photos in the dome and out in the garden. The dome is comfortable and nicely decorated. The food is very tasty as well. Thank you for the nice experience ", "Nestled in the serene surroundings of Seletar Airport, The Summerhouse stands as one of Singapore's most enchanting outdoor wedding venues. It offers couples the opportunity to exchange vows in a rustic garden setting, creating a truly magical atmosphere. With its historic bungalow and charming banquet space, we have truly enjoyed shooting weddings here over the years!"], "ChIJ4YzLJwcV2jERue3Aozqfo8Q": ["My wife and i just celebrated our 1st wedding anniversary at The Summerhouse. We got married at the same exact spot a year ago and we returned for our 1st anniversarywas pleasantly surprised that Vicki remembers us.

We came on a Sunday night and the restaurant was well-staffed, and the service was friendly and efficient. The food is decent, not great.- Flambed prawns were excellent- Heirloom tomatoes - can give it a miss- Lamb chops - good portion and well cooked.- Confit de Canard - small portion and was a tad dry- Wagyu was so-so but the potato pure was delicious and had a nice smoked flavour- Cauliflower steak - portion was a tad small but well cooked. The flavours was a little too subtle", "Excellent service. You can see the dedication of the crew from the food they serve. Tried the communal menu and was told they always revise their menu every 3 months and even flew their chef over to France for training. The ambience was great. The summerhouse is a little secluded but that's what give this place a cosy country feel. Looking forward to the next visit.", "Came here for a nice family brunch and we really like the ambience of the place which was very open and had loads of natural lightOrdered a set meal with organic egg, steak, and creme brle. We also got the duck confit, buttermilk galette, scallops, prawn salad and baby chicken along with a cheese platterThe cheeses were a little too strong for our liking but the salad, seafood and meats were cooked well. The organic egg was also much tastier than expected. For drinks we ordered a flat white and long black which was strong and to our likingService staff were very attentive to us. We had a delayed order and they did a great job in handling it tooAlthough price point is slightly higher, I would definitely come back for special occasions and celebrations ", "Dempsey Hill of the North ... and it's right at Park Lane in Seletar! I had always heard about this place, but never got around to come here, until I know about Au Balcon. The menu here looks very attractive to me and so here I am. I'm totally wowed by the surroundings of this place. Coming here is like walking into an exclusive estate where the classy bungalow house is surrounded by lawns and stretches of lush greenery with no high rise buildings in sight. And with the good food here, this is really a bon viviant's dream come true where one just simply enjoys the finer things in life. This place is totally instagram-worthy.Housed above Wildseed Cafe on the second floor, Au Balcon is an enclosed space that feels more like an open area due to the whole stretch of large windows lining most of the perimeter of the dining room. So a bon viviant can enjoy the comforts of air-condition and still indulge in the feel of dining outdoors, being surrounded by the greenery with lots of natural light. The place is classy with a homely touch due to the whitewashed walls, hanging plants, classic wooden table tops, and white wooden chairs with lovely floral print cushions.To complete the experience, service is very good, being friendly and efficient. Definitely a place I will recommend to enjoy a moment of life away from the buzz and bustle of urban city.Mudcrab Omelette looks so beautiful, with the flowers and herbs adorning the perfectly prepared omelette that is solid on the outside to hold all the goodies within and runny on the inside. So the runny egg throughly coats the briny sweet mud crab, and with pungent spring onion and the stretchy, slightly gooey Gruyere cheese mixed in, this is pure delight on the palates.Grilled prawns features super huge, succulent, meaty kelong prawns. The shells are so thin and nicely cooked to crispy consistency that I easily eat them along with the sweet flesh. The smoky aroma of the slightly charred surface of the meat makes it all the more better. Ah, eating this is enjoyment ...I totally love the Yoghurt Sorbet here because it is super refreshing in taste. And it looks very pretty too. The yoghurt is creamy yet light on the palates, going so well with the mint jelly. The honeycomb crispy yoghurt gives a nice variation in texture. I love this so much.This place is so good for spending a lazy afternoon, or gatherings with friends and family at night due to the perfect ambience. I saw the LED lights setup outside the restaurant, so I figured it will look very pretty at night too. The food is very good too, being pleasing to most palates. Most of the items on the menu are well-catered to local tastes. Now, I want so much to bring my loved ones or friends to here to just enjoy some relaxing time here.Thoughts: Enjoying Life!"], "ChIJb0VNtp8V2jERUs8RvrnFbmw": ["Pretty much everything that we ordered was delicious!
