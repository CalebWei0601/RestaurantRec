# RestaurantRec

When I go out with my family, they always don't know what to eat so usually I am the one left with the painful task of deciding the spot.

By the time I finally propose something like Korean BBQ, they may reject and say they now want sushi and don't know where to go.

This is what inspired me to try and build this project - a restaurant recommender that takes a moody message describing what the gang would like to eat today (in the ideal case).

Currently with the help of Google API I have obtained information and reviews on more than 1300 restaurants in Singapore.  The next step is to come up with a reliable NLP model that would allow me to compare similarities between the user input message and these reviews, and output the restaurant that most resembles the input message.

The plan is to then wrap it in Flask and Bingo!

I'll update this as I go.
